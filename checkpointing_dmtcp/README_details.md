# README

This contains some further information on files in here that users do not 
need to know. README.txt is copied to /shared/eresearch/pbs_job_examples/
but not this file.

These example PBS scripts come from https://github.com/rohgarg/dmtcp-job-scripts

    dmtcp_launch_job_original.sh
    dmtcp_restart_job_original.sh

The `readdmtcp.sh` was not in the yum package for dmtcp so I downloaded it from 
https://github.com/rohgarg/dmtcp (it is in the "util" directory).

Mike Lake created the PBS job scripts below based on the examples above.
  
    job_no_dmtcp.sh
    job_launch_dmtcp.sh
    job_restart_dmtcp.sh
