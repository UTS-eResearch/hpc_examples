These example PBS scripts come from https://github.com/rohgarg/dmtcp-job-scripts

    dmtcp_launch_job_original.sh
    dmtcp_restart_job_original.sh

readdmtcp.sh  
The readdmtcp.sh was not in the yum package for dmtcp so I downloaded it from 
https://github.com/rohgarg/dmtcp (it is in the "util" directory).
